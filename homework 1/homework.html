          <h2>Sales Manager Mammadov Nicat</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Nicat. As a sales representative specializing in sales, I have
            been developing successful sales strategies in different sectors for
            years, managing teams and contributing to the growth of companies.
            Increasing customer satisfaction and achieving company goals by
            correctly analyzing customer needs is my priority. Thanks to my
            communication skills, problem-solving skills and strategic thinking
            style, I motivate my teammates and ensure that they constantly
            exceed their sales goals. At the same time, I like to quickly adapt
            to changing market conditions and produce innovative solutions. I
            use everything I have learned throughout my career to achieve
            better, and I see continuous development and learning as a part of
            my life.
          </p>
          <h2>Self-Improvement</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to my professional journey in the sales world, I am
            interested in Front-End development in my spare time. Working with
            basic web technologies such as HTML and CSS, designing my own
            projects and creating visually simple but effective interfaces both
            relaxes me and encourages me to think creatively. Creating my own
            portfolio, trying out small websites or implementing a user-friendly
            design with code; offers the opportunity to combine technical
            knowledge with a sense of aesthetics. This field has become a hobby
            where I both express myself and learn new things.
